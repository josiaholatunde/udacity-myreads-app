# MyReads Project

Ogunboyejo Olatunde 
Udacity Nanodegree Project 1

## Introduction
This application is a book shelf application that consists majorly of two pages. The main page comprises 3 sections: The books the reader is currently reading, the books the reader wants to read, and the books that the reader has read. Each of the books has a button which could be used to change the status of the book from one shelf/category to another. It does this by making an update http query to an endpoint which modifies the status of that book. 

The search page has an input box which could be used to search for a book based on several sort parameters. The state of the book on the main page is held on the search page. The status of the book also updates on the main page when the reader changes the status on the main page.


## Mode of usage
On the main page, Click on the button on any of the books and move to a different shelf. You should observe that the book is now in the appropriate shelf.

Click on the arrow icon at the bottom of the page which leads to the search page. Search for the book which you moved to a different bookshelf. You should notice by now that it holds the same shelf state as that on the main page.

## TL;DR

### Setting up the application

To get started developing right away:
* clone the application at https://github.com/josiaholatunde/udacity-myreads-app
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## What You're Getting
```bash

    ├── index.css # Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
    └── index.js # You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
